# Orion

**Turn unstructured text into a living knowledge graph — in under two minutes.**

Orion reads documents, emails, reviews, reports, or any free-form text and automatically discovers the entities (people, teams, projects, systems, decisions) and relationships hidden inside. It then lets you explore, question, and simulate the resulting graph.

A standalone Flask webapp you can run locally with just an OpenAI (or Azure OpenAI) API key.

## Why Orion

Every team has the same invisible problem: the data about **who does what, with whom, for what outcome** lives trapped in disconnected documents. Spreadsheets, review packets, email threads, project updates. Traditional tools show you a flat org chart or a list. Orion shows you the *network*.

One natural-language question — *"If our lead engineer leaves, what breaks?"* — becomes a 60-second interactive exploration instead of a week of manual tracing.

## Features

- **Multi-agent extraction pipeline** — schema inference → entity extraction → deduplication, each stage an LLM agent
- **Domain templates** — pre-tuned ontologies for communication, process, code, workflow, legal, contracts, data analysis, and team management; or fully auto-detected
- **Interactive graph** — search, filter by type, zoom, fit, export as PNG / JSON / CSV
- **Natural-language Q&A** — ask questions grounded in the extracted graph
- **What-If simulation** — multi-round agent simulation of how the network adapts when you change it; interview individual entities in first person
- **Find connection** — shortest-path search between any two entities with an LLM-generated explanation of every hop
- **Document intelligence** — `.pdf`, `.docx`, `.pptx`, `.xlsx`, `.csv`, `.txt`, `.md`, images, `.msg`, `.eml` all supported; PDFs and images go through LLM-Vision OCR
- **OpenAI + Azure OpenAI** support out of the box

## Quick start (standalone Flask)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/intelliorion/orion_kg.git
cd orion_kg/webapp

python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

cp .env.example .env
# edit .env and set OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

python app.py
# → http://localhost:5001
```

### Try the included example

Open `http://localhost:5001`, click **Get Started**, paste the contents of [`examples/portfolio_review.txt`](examples/portfolio_review.txt) into the Data drawer, and hit Build. You should see ~40 entities across people, teams, projects, and outcomes, with relationships like `LEADS`, `SPONSORS`, `DEPENDS_ON`, and `DELIVERED`.

### Azure OpenAI instead of OpenAI

Swap the three `OPENAI_*` variables in `.env` for:

```dotenv
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=...
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://your-resource.openai.azure.com
AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION=2024-12-01-preview
```

Orion auto-detects Azure when both `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` and `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY` are present.

## Architecture

```
Browser (vis.js)                 Flask backend
+-----------------+              +------------------------------------+
|  Graph view     |              |  Session manager                   |
|  Entities tab   |   REST       |  Extraction pipeline               |
|  Report tab     |   + SSE      |    Agent 0 — schema inference      |
|  Q&A tab        |<------------>|    Agent 1 — entity extraction     |
|  What-If tab    |              |    Agent 2 — deduplication         |
|  Find-conn tab  |              |  NetworkX DiGraph in memory        |
+-----------------+              |  OpenAI / Azure OpenAI              |
                                 +------------------------------------+
```

- Sessions are in-memory; restart clears them.
- The graph renders progressively — entities appear in the UI as each chunk is extracted.
- All LLM calls are synchronous per chunk; the build runs in a background thread so the UI stays live.

## Configuration

Tunable constants live in `config/settings.py` and at the top of each webapp's Python entrypoint. You can override models via environment variables:

| Variable | Purpose | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | OpenAI auth | *required* (unless Azure) |
| `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY` | Azure OpenAI auth | — |
| `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` | Azure OpenAI endpoint | — |
| `AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION` | Azure API version | `2024-12-01-preview` |
| `ORION_DEFAULT_MODEL` | Model to use by default | auto-pick |
| `ORION_MODELS` | Comma-separated model list shown in the UI | auto-probe |

## Contributing

Pull requests welcome. For significant changes, please open an issue first to discuss scope.

- Don't commit secrets — `.env` is git-ignored by default
- Prefer small, focused commits with descriptive messages
